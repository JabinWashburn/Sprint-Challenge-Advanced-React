- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

I would not use class components over function components because function components are more DRY code and cleaner. So unless an employer insisted on using class components i would not choose them over function components. 

- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

3. componentWillMount, Constructor equal to createClass

Hooks are made to help keep code dry and not have to write so many components all the time for reuseable situations. 

- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?

It's important to test apps for vulnerablities, and useability. If a user can make the app function properly it will not be used at all. If it is vulnerable user data and information could be at risk.
